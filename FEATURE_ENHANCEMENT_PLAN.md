## üìù Enhancement Notes

**Philosophy**: Enhance the core experience without compromising simplicity or privacy
**User-Driven**: Let user feedback guide enhancement priorities
**Quality Focus**: Better to implement fewer features excellently than many features poorly
**Future-Proof**: Build enhancements with long-term sustainability in mind

The enhancement plan should evolve based on real user feedback and usage patterns from the MVP release.
